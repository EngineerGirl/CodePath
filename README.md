### My Todo App (Name: Priorityeee)
######Before starting to make this app, I referred the article below, which helped me plan and design my Priorityeee App.

######I wanted to keep my to-do app simple, mainly because of the fact that people are going back to the pen and paper style instead of using an app. 
######My app does exactly what a to do list is supposed to do. It takes notes, with a heading for each list.
######Allows you to put a star to the list to prioritize it, which automatically takes the list to the top of all the other lists.
######Also, if there is no priority, your latest list is the top of the list.
######Last but not the least, it gives a sense of satisfaction by allowing the user to click on check, when you complete a particular task on your to-do list.
